        description: `
        Food self-sufficiency is a strategic plan that has been set by the Indonesian government 
        to achieve zero hunger for all Indonesian people. One way to achieve it is by improving 
        the productivity of crops cultivation. However, a data from the Indonesian Ministry of 
        Agriculture states that Indonesia has experienced a decline in crops harvest area by 
        an average of 1.76% in 2005-2015. A decline in crops production productivity is 
        further backed by a data submitted by the Central Bureau of Statistics. According to them, 
        Indonesia has experienced a consistent decline in the growth of gross domestic product in the 
        field of agricultural business in 2014-2016. In order to achieve food self-sufficiency, 
        we require an information system that can be used to monitor factors which may be detrimental 
        to crops production, in particular, pests and diseases. The emergence of pests and diseases 
        also has high causality with the dynamics of climatic conditions that occur in a particular area. 
        The emergence of pests and diseases that attack crops plants can be analyzed based on the 
        climatic conditions that have occurred. This research is carried out by utilizing a statistical 
        approach to predict the types of diseases that will attack at certain times. This study utilizes 
        data on the areas of corn fields that are attacked by certain pests and diseases based on climatic 
        conditions. We used Linear Regression and Natural Spline as prediction algorithms.
